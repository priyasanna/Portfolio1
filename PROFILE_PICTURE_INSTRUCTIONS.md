# Profile Picture Instructions

## Adding Your Profile Picture

To add your profile picture to the portfolio:

1. **Add your image file** to the root directory of this project
2. **Name it:** `profile-picture.jpg` (or update the filename in `index.html` line 20)
3. **Recommended size:** 300x300 pixels or larger (square image works best)
4. **Supported formats:** JPG, PNG, or WebP

### Current Setup

The portfolio is currently looking for: `profile-picture.jpg`

If the image doesn't load, a placeholder with your initials "LS" will be displayed automatically.

### To Change the Image:

1. Replace `profile-picture.jpg` with your image
2. Or update the `src` attribute in `index.html` line 20:
   ```html
   <img src="your-image-name.jpg" alt="Lakshmipriya Solai" class="profile-picture" id="profilePicture">
   ```
